## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(e1071)
set.seed(32343)
modelFit <- train(type~.,data = training,method="glm")
modelFit
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
modelFit$finalModel
predictions <- predict(modelFit,newdata=testing)
predictions
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
confusionMatrix(predictions,testing$type)
```
```{r}
folds <- createFolds(y=spam$type,k=10,list = TRUE,returnTrain = TRUE)
sapply(folds,length)
folds[[1]][1:10]
```
```{r}
fold <- createResample(y=spam$type,times=10,list=TRUE)
sapply(fold,length)
```
```{r}
tme <- 1:1000
folds1 <- createTimeSlices(y=tme,initialWindow = 20,horizon = 10)
names(folds1)
folds1$test[[1]]
```
